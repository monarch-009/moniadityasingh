  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I code by day and dream by night, weaving logic and story gracefully. I
    wander through books and history, finding inspiration in the stars. Each
    algorithm becomes a poem of purpose, connecting structure with wonder. I
    blend philosophy with software, art with technology, seeking meaning in
    nature’s quiet patterns. Every project feels like exploring the cosmos,
    where logic meets imagination. In code, I craft stories, bridging reason
    with curiosity and finding beauty in every line. My soul finds joy in the
    dance of code and words, weaving reason into dreams.
